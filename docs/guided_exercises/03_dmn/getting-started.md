# Getting Started with Decision Model and Notation

This lab introduces you to the deployment of an existing Decision Model and Notation (DMN) and validation of it's decisions.

- Explore an existing DMN file created using Business Central
- Deploy the existing DMN project to Decision Server
- Test the deployed DMN

## Examine Existing DMN Diagram

The following example describes an *insurance* price calculator based on an applicant’s age and accident history. This is a simple decision process based on the following decision table:

|  ![Completed Decision Table](../99_images/business_automation/dmn/insurance-price-dt.png){:width="600px"}  |
| :--:|
|  **DMN Decision Table**|

- The decision table was designed without using Business Central tools, but could be imported seemlesly due to the conformity with DMN specification.

- The DMN decision table includes a *hit policy*, *inputs*, and *outputs*.

- Unlike the drl based decision tables that can be created in Business Central, input and output names in DMN decision tables accept spaces.

- The conditions for the `Age` input is defined using the Friendly Enough Expression Language (FEEL).

The *decision* can also be represented by the following decision requirements diagram:

![Insurance Pricing Requirements Diagram](../99_images/business_automation/dmn/insurance-price-drd.png){:width="600px"}

- In this decision requirements diagram, note that the applicant’s age and accident history are the required inputs for the decision table "Insurance Total Price".

- The DMN component is currently stored in the [DMN GitHub repository](https://github.com/timwuthenow/dmn-workshop-labs).

## Import the DMN File into KIE Sandbox

In this section, you will import the GitHub repository to KIE Sandbox directly.

1. Copy to this [Raw DMN file](https://github.com/timwuthenow/dmn-workshop-labs/blob/master/policy-price/insurance-pricing.dmn) and click the Raw Button or simply copy the link from the below command.

    ![Raw DMN click](../99_images/business_automation/dmn/raw-dmn-button.png)

    ~~~bash
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/timwuthenow/dmn-workshop-labs/master/policy-price/insurance-pricing.dmn
    ~~~

1. With this link navigate to the [{{ product.sandbox }}](https://sandbox.kie.org) and under **Import </> From URL** paste the link from the previous step and click **Import**.

    ![Import DMN](../99_images/business_automation/dmn/import-dmn.png)

1. When the project is imported, you will see the DMN Editor with the **insurance-pricing** DMN model displayed. If you instead of pointing to a particular DMN, pointed to an entire project, any DMN/BPMN models associated with it would be able to viewed/edited within {{ product.sandbox }}.

    ![Sandbox Model](../99_images/business_automation/dmn/imported-dmn.png)

1. You can then click the **Run** button to get a local copy of this DMN running within the browser session itself.

    ![Run DMN](../99_images/business_automation/dmn/dmn-run.png)

1. This will have a section of the browser turn into a form and you can run the model right there. Modifying the checkbox based on the boolean of `had previous incidents` and set an `Age` based on the data type being a number.

    > 📘 INFO: There is a known issue around the DMN Runner with forms that does not initially assume a non-checked box is false on the first successful execution. To quickly get around this, check and uncheck the checkbox and move forward with your testing

    ![Form inputs](../99_images/business_automation/dmn/form-input-exec.png)

1. If you link your OpenShift login to the gear icon, you can even do a sample deployment of this as a service into OpenShift. For now this will conclude this section.

## Importing a DMN in Business Central

If you want to try this in Business Central, you can go through the following steps, but it is not required.

1. From the GitHub web page, click **Clone or download** on the right and then select **Download ZIP**:

1. Using your favorite file system navigation tool, locate the downloaded ZIP file and unzip it to a directory in your file system.

    - From this point forward, this location is referred to as `$PROJECT_HOME`.

1. Log in to Business Central. You can use either `bamAdmin:ibmpam1!` or `pamadmin:pamadm1n` to do so or whatever login you have created on your instance.

1. Create a project in Business Central called `policy-price`.

1. In the empty project library view for the `policy-price` project, click **Import Asset**.

    ![Policy Pricing Import Asset](../99_images/business_automation/dmn/policy-price-importing-items.png){:width="600px"}

1. In the **Create new Uploaded file** dialog, enter `insurance-pricing.dmn` in the **Uploaded file** field:

    ![Filled out import](../99_images/business_automation/dmn/insurance-pricing-dmn-name.png){:width="600px"}

1. Using the browse button at the far right of the field labeled **Please select a file to upload**, navigate with the file browser to the `$PROJECT_HOME` directory where the unzipped Git repository is located.

1. Select the `$PROJECT_HOME\policy-price\insurance-pricing.dmn` file.

1. Click **Ok** to import the DMN asset.

1. The diagram will open and you will be able to see the DRD. Explore the diagram nodes to check the decision policies of this diagram. 

    ![Pricing DRD](../99_images/business_automation/dmn/insurance-pricing-drd-added.png){:width="600px"}

1. Close the diagram. You should now be on the library view for the `policy-price` project.

1. You should see the `insurance-pricing` asset is added to your project assets:

    ![Pricing imported](../99_images/business_automation/dmn/insurance-pricing-dmn-added.png){:width="600px"}

1. From the `policy-price` project’s library view, click **Build**, then **Deploy** to deploy the project to the execution server.

1. After receiving the build confirmation, navigate to the container deployment list by clicking the "**View deployment details**" link in the confirmation pop-up, or by selecting **Menu → Deploy → Execution Servers**.

1. Verify that `policy-price_2.0.0` shows a *green* status:

    ![Container deployed for DMN in KIE Server](../99_images/business_automation/dmn/policy-price-container.png){:width="600px"}

## Testing the Decision Service on KIE Server

In this section, you test the DMN solution using the REST endpoints available in the Decision Server (a.k.a. KIE Server).

1. Open your Decision Server (a.k.a KIE Server) on the url "/docs". You should see something like this:

    ![Swagger Home](../99_images/business_automation/dmn/kie-server-swagger-ui.png){:width="600px"}

1. Next, under `DMN Models`, click on the `POST /server/containers/{containerId}/dmn"` and select "Try it out": 

   ![Post to KIE](../99_images/business_automation/dmn/kie-server-try-it-out.png){:width="600px"}

1. Now use the following data:

   - Container ID: `policy-price`
   - Body (dmn context): `{"dmn-context": {"Age": 20, "had previous incidents": false}}`
   - Parameter content type: `application/json`

   ![Swagger DMN](../99_images/business_automation/dmn/kie-server-post-data.png){:width="600px"}

1. Click on the **execute** button. You should see the server response `200` and the results of the decision.

    ![DMN Post Result](../99_images/business_automation/dmn/kie-server-dmn-result.png){:width="600px"}

1. Try out the Decision with different values for the age and accident history, and compare the results with the decision table:

## Conclusion

Congratulations, you've finished the getting started exercise. Next, you will have an intermediate level exercise that will guide you through the implementation, deployment and testing of the Vacation Days use case.
